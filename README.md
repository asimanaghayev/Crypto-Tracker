### Project Insights

App is consisted from multiple modules where each has specific purposes. This modular structure
gives us opportunity to divide our forthcoming features into different modules. And by that we can
handle those features without affecting any unrelated part of application.
App has single-activity architecture where our activity handles navigation and some base stuff and
we use fragments for each of our screens.
And lastly for design pattern of project MVVM design pattern is used.
Project is written in [Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org/) language.
